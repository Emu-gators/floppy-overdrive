# Hardware

## Overview

This folder contains the files relevant to the hardware-based aspects of the Floppy Overdrive project, including HDL code and design schematics.

/ADC_Test contains the Verilog code for the partial ADC pulse generator circuit.
/control_board contains the Verilog code for the control circuit and the Makefiles for using it with the control board PCB.
/misc contains as-of-yet unused RTL files.

## FPGA Build Instructions

Build insturctions currently vary by circuit. Check the README file in the respective folders for further information on building each circuit for an FPGA device.
