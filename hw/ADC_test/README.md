# ADC Test Circuit

This folder contains the files created during the testing of the LTC1420 ADC circuit. Since these files are currently incomplete, they are provided without the files required to build them. These files were designed for the DE-10 Nano FPGA development board, but could be adapted to any FPGA device.

For reference, the schematic for the x100 gain preamplifier circuit is also provided here. This design is currently implemented on the control board and has been tested independedntly without any issues.
